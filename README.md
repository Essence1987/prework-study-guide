# <Pre-Work Study Guide>

## Description

I have always been interested in Coding, but I never took it to heart as I chose to major in Business Management with an Emphasis on Enterpernual Management. In time I was able to launch a Brick and Mortar Retail business. However, unbeknownst to me, it would only last briefly. After only two years, The Property Manager informed me that our building was under new ownership. The new owner had decided to evict all the businesses on the property to demolish the building to make room for a new apartment complex.

As the closing date drew nearer, I had to decide between attempting to reestablish my business in a new location and paying significant money to prepare a new building to fit my needs or taking a different route and leaving my old business behind me. After discussing things further with my wife, my brother, who works as a Software Engineer, and other friends and family, I decided to pursue a new direction in my life through a topic I have always been interested in. I decided to return to school and receive the training to become a professional coder. 

I am building this project as one of my very first portfolios. It will show others what I have learned and provide me a location to go back to and reference as the need arrives. It will track my progress and give others a brief glimpse into my progress as I endeavor deeper into the Coding field. 

Though my time with this project has been brief to date, I have already begun to learn the fundamental building blocks of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As time passes and more progress appears on my GitHub page, I will update this readme file to provide more information for you, the reader, and others who may be interested in my work and my journey into the unknown.

## Installation

## Usage

Each section contains notes about specific topics I am in the process of studying or have studied so far, including, but not limited to, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. You can see the JavaScript running if you open the DevTools Console with CTRL + SHIFT + I (Windows) or Command + Options + I (MacOS). It will show a list of topics I have learned from prework and run a command to show one topic for me or others to study.
